# demographic-scaling-model

The `demographic-scaling-model` is designed to estimate in a straightforward manner the total number and prevalence of COVID-19 infections for countries worldwide.

A preprint is available on [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.23.20077719v2), [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12836), and [OSF](https://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/GQYJA).

We provide here the **[Latest results](#latest-results)** as well as **[How to run](#how-to-run)** the R source code to generate them.

## Latest results

For the ten countries with most reported deaths as of July 23, 2020:

## How to run

The code needs to be executed in four steps, as defined by `step-*.R` files in the root directory.

### Prerequisites

- The `info-input-data.txt` file contains information about required input data.
  
- Due to copyrights you will need to download and save input data yourself. Original file names and URLs where to download them are given in the `info-input-data.txt` file. 

- Input data include confirmed cases and reported deaths attributable to COVID-19 of JHU CSSE (2020), population counts and abridged life tables of UNWPP 2019, infection fatality rates by 10-year age groups as, for example, published in Verity et al. (2020), and global age distribution of COVID-19 deaths as, for example, calculated based on data of Dudel et al. (2020).

- Make sure you have set the correct working directories before you start. 

### Execution

Run the `step-*.R` scripts in the root directory in the prescribed order.
